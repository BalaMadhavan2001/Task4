# DevOps Project - Task 4

This repository is part of AWS EC2 Instance Task 4: Build a Version-Controlled DevOps Project with Git.

## Objectives
- Initialize and manage a Git repository.
- Use branching strategy (`main`, `dev`, `feature` branches).
- Create pull requests for merging.
- Add `.gitignore` and tags.
- Document all tasks in markdown.

## Branches
- **main**: Production-ready code.
- **dev**: Development and integration branch.
- **feature/***: Feature-specific work.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Switch to `dev` branch for development.
3. Create feature branches for new work.
4. Open pull requests to merge into `dev`, then into `main`.
